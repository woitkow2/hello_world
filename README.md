Hello Everyone!!

My name is Danielle, and I survive this world off of starbucks coffee and family love. 
I'm a mother, a student, a homeschool teacher, a full-time plus PACS Admin, and a wife. I lead a very busy life, but I do it for the my family that I love more than life itself. One day I will walk off my porch and see Lake Superior with a cup of coffee in hand and my laptop in the other watching my daughter run around with our beagle, Mikey.
